# 🃏 PYRAMID SOLITAIRE


This repository contains the **Pyramid Solitaire** card game developed as part of the **Data Structures** course project.
The project focuses on designing, implementing, and analyzing a real-world card game with a **graphical user interface (GUI)** while respecting course constraints.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to:

* Understand and implement the complete rules of **Pyramid Solitaire**
* Design multiple versions of the game under different constraints
* Analyze the effectiveness and limitations of each design approach
* Develop an interactive GUI-based application in C++

Three versions of the game are designed.
One version is **fully functional**, while the others demonstrate **partial implementations** to support comparative analysis, as required by the project guidelines.
